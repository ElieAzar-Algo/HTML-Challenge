       <h3><strong> Today’s AI</strong></h3>
       <p>
        Without any doubt, today’s biggest buzzword is Artificial Intelligence or AI. Most prominent research organizations, including Gartner, McKinsey, and PWC, have glorified the future of AI with mind-blowing statistics and future predictions. Here is the PWC’s report (2018), where it predicts that by 2030, AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy. The overall productivity & GDP will increase by 55% and 14%, respectively. As signed by the US President Donald J. Trump, the executive order could quickly demonstrate the importance of AI within the united states.

        We have several examples in our daily lives where we leverage Artificial Intelligence without even noticing. This includes google maps, smart replies in Gmail (2018+), facebook picture tagging (2015 approx), youtube/NetFlix video recommendations (2016+), etc. There are also some astonishing news reports outlining the significance and reach of AI; like this one (2019) where Novak Djokovic used AI in Wimbledon’s final, or look at this website (launched in 2019) with 100% fake pictures of people who look 100% real leveraging deep neural networks (Deep Learning).
         This list goes on and on.

         <b>Traditional AI (1950–2008)</b>
         <br><br>
         The term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined in 1956, at a historic conference in Dartmouth. At that early stage of AI development, scientists and media hype made utopian claims around the possibilities of AI breakthroughs. Some scientists made it so clear that in the next 20 years, the machine will do everything that humans possibility could do.
