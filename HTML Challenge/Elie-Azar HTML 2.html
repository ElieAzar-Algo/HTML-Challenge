              <h2>Free School of Programming</h2>
              <p>Codi is a free school of programming for people who have a passion for digital and want to build a career in technology but cannot pursue a traditional university education.
                <br>It is the first training centre to foster digital and technical skills for the youth in Lebanon. Our courses are open to everyone but primarily targeted to youth, who are not currently employed, with little academic background, and otherwise marginalised from society (incl. refugees).
